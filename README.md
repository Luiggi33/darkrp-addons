If you find a bug please submit an Issue on github!

# Addons
 - Lucid AC is a simple anticheat made for getting rid of script kiddies, it's focus is a low resource usage
 - Lucid Chat is a simple chatbox which has modern features like arrow-up for previous messages and TAB for switching say-modes
 - Lucid Chocolate Maker is a new legal job that lets you make chocolate with a stove and sell it to an NPC
 - Lucid FPS is a simple FPS Boost window that pops up when you spawn, it only pops up once and then remembers your choice
 - Lucid HUD is a rendition of Elegant HUD but with a simpler design, better code and less resource usage
 - Lucid Logs is a very simple logging system, open with !llogs and check for yourself
 - Lucid M9K Shipments contain every category and weapon (single & shipment) premade to be included in DarkRP
 - Lucid Methlab is a new "dark" job which lets you cook meth and sell it to an NPC
 - Lucid MOTD is a version of mjmotd but with lighter code, simpler look and less resource usage
 - Lucid Propblacklist is a 1000+ props blacklist which automatically inserts into the database. Props are handpicked.
 - Lucid Scoreboard is a fixed version of Elegant HUD, simple and just works
 - Lucid Warn is a minimalistic Warn System based on FreeWarn2 but with completely overhauled and exploit-safe backend
 - Lucid Whitelist is similar to gmodadminsuite-whitelist an addon that enables you to only let specific users access to specific jobs
 - Money-Leaderboard is an edited version which includes the Blue's ATM account into the leaderboard (and not only the money in a players wallet). It's not optimized well because Blue puts everything in a single JSON field in his database.
 - The F4 Menu is a fixed version of TheCodingBeast's F4 Menu taken from his github
