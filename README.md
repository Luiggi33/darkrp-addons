# DarkRP-Addons
Free DarkRP Addons I made (for Eternity RP)

# Addons
 - Lucid AC is a simple anticheat made for getting rid of script kiddies, low resource usage
 - Lucid FPS is a simple FPS Boost window that pops up when you spawn, it only pops up once and then remembers your choice
 - Lucid HUD is a rendition of Elegant HUD but with a simpler design, better code and less resource usage
 - Lucid Logs is a very simple logging system, open with !llogs and check for yourself (This is not intented for big servers with players > 40 because it's way too simple)
 - Lucid MOTD is a version of mjmotd but with lighter code, simpler look and less resource usage
 - Lucid Scoreboard is a fixed version of Elegant HUD, simple and just works
 - Money-Leaderboard is an edited version which includes the Blue's ATM account into the leaderboard (and not only the money in a players wallet). It's not optimized well because Blue puts everything in a single JSON field in his database.
